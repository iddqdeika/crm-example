**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-26

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Redirect behaviour for changed slugs (FR-014) is assumed to be a 301 permanent redirect; this assumption is documented and should be confirmed during planning.
- Non-ASCII / i18n slug transliteration is explicitly out of scope for this iteration.
- Migration of existing posts without slugs (FR-013) is in scope and must be included in the implementation plan.
